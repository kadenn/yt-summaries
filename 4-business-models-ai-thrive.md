## The 4 Business Models

### 1. Consulting / Management Consultancy

**Why it works:**
- Every business is currently undergoing AI-driven transformation and needs expert guidance
- Small, nimble consultancies have major advantages over large firms (less overhead, fewer bureaucratic layers)
- Limited supply + high demand = high profitability
- Companies with $5-50M revenue can afford consulting and achieve strong ROI (e.g., spend $100K to unlock $1M in value)

**How to leverage it:**
- Use your existing skills, experiences, or proof stories from previous roles
- Consult on specific transformations: growth, efficiency, hiring, health & safety, etc.
- Target mid-sized businesses that have revenue to invest and room to improve

### 2. Technical Agency

**Examples:** IT services, engineering, architecture, accounting, legal services

**Why it works:**
- AI handles heavy lifting through co-pilots and automation tools
- Smaller teams of highly qualified experts can accomplish much more with AI assistance
- Opportunity for arbitrage: leverage technical expertise + AI + remote workers to serve larger companies
- These businesses have historically been inefficient—AI makes them high-margin

**The shift required:**
- Most technical businesses are "supply-side focused" (focused on doing the work)
- Success requires becoming "demand-side focused" (focused on winning the work)
- You don't need to be the technical expert yourself—you can hire, co-found, or acquire a business with technical expertise already in place

**Example:** Richard Branson launched Virgin Atlantic without airline expertise by partnering with Randy Fields (technical expert from Laker Airlines), freeing Branson to focus on promotion.

### 3. Boring/Unglamorous Service Business

**Examples:**
- Local council contractors
- Air conditioning maintenance
- Elevator repair
- Cleaning services
- Waste removal
- Electrical contracting
- Printing/publishing
- Basic IT/help desk services

**Why it works:**
- These businesses consistently generate profit while "exciting" ventures lose money
- Wealthy individuals have built fortunes in these overlooked sectors
- They're a "license to print money" when run properly

**The key:** Treat boring businesses like exciting ones—understand what makes them valuable and apply modern marketing/branding approaches.

### 4. Software as a Service (SaaS)

**Why it works:**
- Provides 5-10x value relative to subscription cost (charge $30/month, deliver $100-300/month in value)
- Subscription revenue is recurring and sticky once embedded in organizations
- AI has dramatically reduced development costs: what cost $500K+ now costs $10-30K
- Much smaller development teams needed
- Once you cover operating costs, new subscribers = nearly 100% profit margin

**Mindset shift:**
- You don't need to be a coder or technical expert
- Entrepreneurial skills matter most: understanding what to build, how to sell it, marketplace dynamics
- Entrepreneurs translate market needs to developers
- Small team can create powerful products
- 1,000-5,000 subscribers = incredibly valuable business

## The Secret Ingredient: The Key Person of Influence (Founder Brand)

### Why Personal Branding is Critical

**LinkedIn research:** Personal brands are **20x more powerful** than business brands.

### The Profit Formula

**Traditional approach (fails):**
- Focus on supply side (doing the work)
- Results in wages at best, no real profit

**Winning approach:**
- Key person of influence drives demand (demand side)
- Constrained supply of services
- Result: High profitability when demand exceeds supply

### How It Works

- Build a personal brand with tens of thousands of followers
- Generate views and engagement
- Funnel audience to one of the four business models
- Personal brand becomes the demand engine

### The 5 P's Framework for Key Person of Influence

1. **Pitching** - Strong presentation skills
2. **Publishing** - Regular content online
3. **Products** - Focus on product choices/improvements
4. **Profile** - Raise your visibility
5. **Partnerships** - Joint ventures and collaborations

## Selling Your Business (With a Personal Brand)

### Common Misconception
Many believe personal brands prevent business sales—this is false.

### How It Actually Works

**Example:** Richard Branson sells Virgin companies regularly.

**The process:**
1. Build systems and hire talented team to run operations
2. Sell business to larger competitor
3. Get hired as key person of influence post-sale
4. Continue involvement for 12-18 months (e.g., one day/month for video/consulting)
5. Receive purchase price + ongoing high day rates

**Result:** Business sale proceeds + additional cash flow stream from continued involvement

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI enhances rather than destroys** these four business models when implemented correctly
2. **Small and nimble beats large and bureaucratic** in the AI era
3. **Focus on demand generation**, not just service delivery—this is where profit lives
4. **You don't need to be the technical expert**—you need to be the entrepreneur who drives demand
5. **Personal brand is 20x more powerful** than business brand—lead with yourself
6. **These models are proven and robust**, not experimental or trendy
7. **Build to sell:** Systems + team + personal brand = valuable, saleable asset

## Action Steps

- Identify which of the four models aligns with your skills and experience
- Start building your personal brand using the 5 P's framework
- Focus on becoming the "key person of influence" in your industry
- Drive demand while constraining supply for maximum profitability
- Build systems that allow the business to operate without you (making it sellable)

**Bottom line:** In an AI-disrupted world, the winners will be those who combine AI-enhanced business models with powerful personal brands that drive demand. The business model matters, but the founder brand is what makes it thrive.
