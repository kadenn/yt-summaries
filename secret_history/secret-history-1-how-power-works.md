# Secret History #1 – How Power Works

**Core Thesis:**
Power works by **shaping imagination**—turning abstractions into lived reality. Concepts like **money, the individual, and the nation-state do not objectively exist**, yet they govern behavior because people believe in them. This is modern “alchemy”: turning nothing into everything.

---

## 1. Epistemology: How Reality Is Constructed

**Kantian foundation**

- Humans cannot access objective reality (“noumena”).
- We perceive reality through mental frameworks (“phenomena”).
- Time and space are not inherent properties of reality; they are cognitive tools.
- **Reality is imagined, not discovered**.

**Implication**

- Life is an ongoing act of imagination.
- Whoever controls imagination controls reality.
- The course aims to **train imagination**, not dictate beliefs.

---

## 2. Course Method: Past, Present, Future

- **Present**: Analyze geopolitics (e.g., wars in Ukraine, Middle East).
- **Future**: Use analytical models to make predictions.
- **Past**: Test models by reinterpreting history.
- Goal is not truth, but **better models** that sharpen critical thinking.

---

## 3. History Is a Tool of Power

- What people learn as “history” is **manufactured by the powerful**.
- History is designed to justify existing power structures.
- The real question: **How does power operate across time?**
- Understanding this leads to psychological and political liberation.

---

## 4. Example #1 – Money as an Instrument of Power

### How money is created

- Banks **create money out of nothing** through lending.
- Fractional reserve banking expands money beyond physical assets.
- Historical origin: gold receipts → contracts → abstract money.
- Central banking emerges from merchant cartels managing risk.

### Key claim

- **Money is not scarce**; it is infinite.
- Scarcity is a belief, not a fact.

### Why poverty exists

- Poverty is **intentionally maintained**.
- Function of poverty:

  - Makes money appear valuable.
  - Forces people to work.
  - Creates fear-based motivation.

### Crises and wars

- Economic crises exist to **destroy excess money**.
- Wars exist to **destroy wealth**, not acquire resources.
- Both reinforce the illusion of scarcity.

**Bottom line**

- Real value is **human labor**, not money.
- Money is an incentive mechanism to extract labor.

---

## 5. Scarcity vs Abundance

- Food and resources are **abundant**, not scarce.
- Hunger exists due to distribution and political control, not lack.
- Waste proves abundance.
- Scarcity mindset is ideological conditioning.

---

## 6. Happiness: Individual vs Collective

**Modern belief**

- Happiness = money, freedom, power, pleasure, individual success.

**Historical reality**

- Happiness was **collective**.
- Individual happiness was meaningless without community well-being.
- Wealth was redistributed via feasts and generosity.
- Reputation came from contribution, not accumulation.

**Key shift**

- The “individual” is a **modern invention**.
- Exile—not death—was the ultimate punishment historically.
- Humans were defined by community, not selfhood.

---

## 7. Two Worldviews of Human Agency

### Worldview 1: Polytheism (Ancient)

- Humans lack control.
- Gods, fate, and forces shape outcomes.
- Power is arbitrary and dangerous.
- Encourages humility and living fully (eudaimonia).

### Worldview 2: Modern Scientific Individualism

- Humans are synapses + memories.
- Everything is internally controllable.
- Therapy, science, and self-optimization promise mastery.

### Radical claim

- **Worldview 1 is more accurate**.
- Worldview 2 benefits power structures.

---

## 8. Why Power Prefers Modern Individualism

- Makes people:

  - Work harder (“your success is your responsibility”).
  - Blame themselves, not systems.
  - Incapable of collective action.

- Redirects suffering inward → depression, distraction, consumption.
- Produces dependence on authority (experts, psychiatrists, institutions).

---

## 9. Authority and Science

- Science functions as a **modern religion**.
- Experts replace gods as unquestionable authority.
- Systems are designed to create dependency, not autonomy.
- Mental health institutions reinforce reliance on authority.

---

## 10. Example #2 – Education as Brainwashing

### What school is _not_

- Not primarily about learning.
- Not about knowledge.
- Not about skill mastery.

### What school is

- A system of **indoctrination**.

### Evidence

- Historically, learning occurred via apprenticeship and experience.
- Modern schooling separates children from parents.
- Separation creates insecurity → obedience.
- Grading labels people as “smart” or “stupid.”

---

## 11. Origins of Mass Schooling

First compulsory public schooling systems:

- **Sparta**
- **Aztecs**
- **Prussia**

**Common trait**

- All were **war societies**.

**Purpose**

- Produce obedience, discipline, conformity.
- Prepare populations for war and state service.

---

## 12. Example #3 – The Nation-State

- Schools indoctrinate belief in the **nation-state**.
- Nation-states are imagined entities presented as moral beings (“Mother China”).
- History, geography, and language instruction reinforce this fiction.

**Historical reality**

- People identified with villages, not nations.
- Nation-states require belief to function.
- Schooling implants a **false collective memory**.

---

## 13. The Three Core Constructs of Power

These are not natural; they are taught:

1. **Money**
2. **The Individual**
3. **The Nation-State**

All require indoctrination.
All enable large-scale control.

---

## 14. Monotheism as the Root

- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are variations of the same structure.
- Monotheism introduced:

  - Abstract authority
  - Universal truth
  - Centralized power

- These ideas later secularized into modern institutions.

---

## 15. Power as Alchemy

- Alchemy = turning lead into gold.
- Modern power **successfully performs alchemy**:

  - Turns belief into obedience.
  - Turns abstraction into lived reality.

- Power = ability to **control imagination**.

---

## 16. Final Takeaways

- Modern life is built on **imagined constructs mistaken for reality**.
- These constructs generate misery, not flourishing.
- This system arose accidentally, not maliciously.
- Humans can **reimagine the world**.
- Goal is to recover **eudaimonia**—human flourishing, creativity, and collective meaning.

---

### One-Sentence Summary

> Power controls the world by shaping imagination—making people believe abstract ideas like money, individualism, and nation-states are real, thereby extracting labor, obedience, and meaning from human life.
